# FACT shift helper

* Calls you on your phone if security limits are
reached, data taking stopped or the QLA exceeds alert limits

    * Just enter your phone number
    * It will call you once at startup for verification.

* *If you want*, it sends you messages and QLA plots via [Telegram Messenger App](https://telegram.org/)

    * Send the `/start` message to the [@factShiftHelperBot](https://telegram.me/factShiftHelperBot) in order to tell it, you are the shifter for tonight.


# the config file

The shift_helper needs some credentials, for example database access to
monitor the QLA results.
At first start of the shifthelper you will be asked for the well known password
to download these credentials.

# Deploy

There is a lot missing here!
